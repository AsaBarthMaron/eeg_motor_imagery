# EEG motor imagery project

The goal of this project is to predict imagined movements (termed 'motor imageries') from EEG recordings. Data is taken from Kaya et al., 2018

There are three paradigms for this BCI task:

* CLA - Three class classification between imagined left hand movements, imagined right hand movements, and a passive state.
* HaLT - Six class classification. Same as CLA but with additional classes for imagined left foot, right foot, and tongue movements.
* 5F - Five class classification for imagined movements for each of the fingers on one hand.

The first method tried is the winner of the BCI competition IV datasets [2a](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/results/#dataset2a) and [2b](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/results/#dataset2b)
